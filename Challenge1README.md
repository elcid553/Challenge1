# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Determine success of plays based on both launch date and funding goal.  
### Purpose
Predict if Louise's play will be likely to be successful based on her launch date and funding.    
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was not done by using any statistical tests, but simply by looking the charts and the visual outcomes.  For the date based outcomes, there are overall more plays in May and June, and a greater proportion of successful plays in this timeframe.  For dollar range outcomes, the more successful plays tended to be the least expensive.    

The main challenge for this weeks Challenge was time.  I could not perfect every step because of limited time.  After the holidays this should not be as much of an issue.  

Another challege I had was for the Outcomes Based on Goals.  I initially created a new sheet in the same excel file but had trouble linking the equations to the original data sheet.  Becuase of time, I decided to just make the table on the original data sheet so I could get this Challenge completed. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
More successful plays launched in May and June.  There were more overall plays that launched during this time period but still a clear elevation of successful plays.  The difference between the number of successful and failed plays throughout the year is steady at between 20-30.  However, during the May-June timeframe, there were 50-60 more successful plays than failed.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The projects with lower budgets were more likely to be successful.  As the goal dollar value increased, the successful plays decreases, and the failures proportionally increased.  There is a spike at the $40,000-45,000 range, but this is an exception as there are only a couple of plays in this group.  The overall trend on the chart is that the more expensive goals are less likely to be successful.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I misinterpretted a lot of the instructions on first read, so I had to go back and repeat my work to make it more correct.  Again, I have time limitations this week.  I am also learning how this course structure and system works.  I am messing up all kinds of things right now.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1)  Spingtime plays are more likely to be successful. 
2)  More plays launch in the spring overall.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Lower dollar amount goals are more likely to be succesful.  Higher dollar amount goals are more likely to fail.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data set of course cannot speak to the level of organization around the play.  A play with a modest fundraising goal that is not well organized, or that does not speak to the wants of the audience is still likely to fail no matter what the charts or statistics show us.  Maybe short plays with simple production are more inline with audiences attention spans, and more inline with how much they are willing to pay for tickets.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For the outcomes by month, I found it useful to look at the delta between successful and failing plays.  The delta was relatively constant around 25 for most of the year but spike up to 55 for the May-June timeframe.
